As of July 2nd, 2014, we have made a change to the gittle
licensing.

gittle is now dual-licensed as Apache 2.0 and GPLv2.  Please
see the files LICENSE_Apache2.0 and LICENSE_GPLv2 for the
gory legalese of the respective licenses.

See: https://github.com/FriendCode/gittle/issues/24
for the backstory behind this change.  In short, our
objective was simply to license gittle in as convenient
and efficacious a manner as possible for its consumers.

If you have any questions about this, drop us a line.  We'll
don our best lawyer costumes, and do what we can to help.

When contributing pull requests to Gittle, please remember
to add yourself as a contributor at the top of any files
you modify.

Thanks!
